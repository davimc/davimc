## 👋 Hi, I’m Davi Matos Carvalho

🚀 I'm a **Full Stack Developer** passionate about building efficient, scalable and modern web applications.  
Currently pursuing a **Master’s degree in Computer and Systems Engineering** at **UEMA (Universidade Estadual do Maranhão)**, where I deepen my knowledge in **artificial intelligence, optimization, and computational systems**.

💡 I specialize in **Java (Spring Boot)** for backend development and **Next.js / React** for frontend, creating robust and responsive applications from end to end.  
I’m also interested in **DevOps practices**, exploring tools that improve deployment, monitoring, and automation.

🧠 Constantly improving my skills in:
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate, REST APIs  
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL  
- **DevOps:** Docker, CI/CD, AWS basics  
- **Research:** Artificial Intelligence, Optimization, Software Engineering

🤝 Open to opportunities where I can **apply my knowledge, contribute to innovative projects**, and grow alongside a team that values learning, scalability, and impact.
