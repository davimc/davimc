## 👋 Hi, I’m Davi Matos Carvalho

🚀 I'm a **Full Stack Developer** passionate about building efficient, scalable and modern web applications.  
Currently, I'm focusing on **Java (Spring Boot)** for backend development and **Next.js / React** for frontend.

💡 I love solving real problems through clean architecture, automation, and good development practices.  
Whenever possible, I also explore **DevOps concepts** to understand the full software delivery lifecycle — from code to cloud.

🧠 I’m constantly improving my skills in:
- Backend: Java, Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate, REST APIs
- Frontend: React, Next.js, TypeScript
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL
- DevOps: Docker, CI/CD, AWS basics

🤝 I’m looking for opportunities to **collaborate on innovative projects** and grow alongside a team that values learning and impact.
